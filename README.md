# configure_Docker_Swarm_v2
I'll provide you with three separate scripts to install and configure Docker Swarm on each of the three servers. Make sure to replace the placeholders with the appropriate IPs and tokens.
To use these scripts, follow these steps:

Copy each script to its respective server.
Give the scripts execute permissions using chmod +x script_name.sh.
Replace <MANAGER_IP> with the IP address of the Swarm Manager server, and <WORKER_TOKEN> with the worker token from the Swarm Manager server.
Execute the scripts on their respective servers using ./script_name.sh.
After running the scripts, your Docker Swarm with 1 manager and 2 worker nodes will be configured and ready to use.
